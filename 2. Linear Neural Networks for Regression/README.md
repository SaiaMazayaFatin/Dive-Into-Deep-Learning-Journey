# Linear Neural Networks for Regression

Before diving into deep learning, we will start with shallow, linear models where inputs connect directly to outputs

Focusing on these first is essential for two reasons:
- **Mastering the Basics**: You can learn core training concepts—like loss functions and data handling—without the distraction of complex architectures.
- **Establishing Baselines**: These models include classic methods like linear and softmax regression. They are vital industry standards and serve as necessary benchmarks for evaluating more "fancy" deep networks.
